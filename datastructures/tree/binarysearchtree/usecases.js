/**
    Binary Search Trees (BSTs) have various applications due to their ability to efficiently store and manage data in a sorted order. 
    Here are some common uses of binary search trees:

    1) Efficient Searching: The primary use of BSTs is efficient searching. 
    With each comparison, the search space is reduced by half, leading to a time complexity of O(log n) for searching operations.

    2) Ordered Data Storage: BSTs naturally store elements in sorted order, making them suitable for scenarios where you need to maintain data in a specific order for quick retrieval.

    3) Dictionary and Symbol Table: BSTs can be used to implement dictionaries or symbol tables, 
    where you store key-value pairs. This is common in programming languages for variable lookup and management.

    4) Range Queries: BSTs are useful for performing range queries, where you need to find elements within a specific range.
    This is often used in databases and search engines.

    5) Dynamic Order Statistics: BSTs can efficiently find the kth smallest or largest element in a set.
    This is useful for finding medians, percentiles, and other order statistics.

    6) Set Operations: BSTs can be used to implement sets and perform set operations like union, 
    intersection, and difference efficiently.

    7) File Systems: File systems often use BSTs to store directory structures efficiently, allowing for quick access to files and directories.

    8) Auto-Completion and Suggestions: BSTs can be used for implementing auto-completion and suggestion features in text editors and search engines.

    9) Balancing Algorithms: Concepts from binary search trees are used in self-balancing binary search trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees, which are important for various applications like databases and language runtimes.

    10) Graph Algorithms: BSTs are used in certain graph algorithms like binary heap implementations used in Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths.

    11) Interval Trees: A specialized type of binary search tree, known as an interval tree, is used to store intervals and perform efficient interval-based operations.

    While binary search trees have these benefits, they also come with limitations,
    such as degeneration into a linked list in the worst case, 
    which degrades their performance to O(n).
    To address this, self-balancing binary search trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees are used to maintain the balance and ensure efficient operations in all cases.
