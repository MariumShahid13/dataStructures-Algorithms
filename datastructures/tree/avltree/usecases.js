 * AVL trees have several important uses due to their balanced nature, which ensures efficient access times for various operations. 
 * Some of the key uses of AVL trees include:

    1) Efficient Search and Retrieval: AVL trees provide fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. The height of the tree is kept in check, ensuring that the maximum number of comparisons required for search operations is logarithmic in the number of nodes.

    2) Ordered Data Storage: AVL trees maintain elements in sorted order, making them useful for scenarios where you need to keep data sorted and quickly retrieve elements in a specific order.

    3) Database Indexing: AVL trees are often used for indexing in databases. They help in quick lookups of data based on indexed fields, improving the performance of database queries.

    4) Self-Balancing Data Structures: AVL trees serve as the foundation for understanding and implementing other self-balancing binary search trees, such as Red-Black trees. These trees are used in a wide range of applications, including C++'s std::map and std::set.

    5) Interval Trees: AVL trees can be extended to implement interval trees, which are useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently search for intervals that overlap with a given interval.

    6) Priority Queues: AVL trees can be used to implement priority queues, where elements are removed in a specific order based on their priority values.

    7) Symbol Tables: AVL trees are used to implement symbol tables, which are data structures used for storing and managing key-value pairs. This is often used in compilers and interpreters to manage variables and their values.

    8) Dynamic Order Statistics: AVL trees can efficiently find the kth smallest or largest element in a set, making them useful for finding percentiles or other order statistics.

    9) File Systems: AVL trees are used in file systems to manage directory structures efficiently. They help organize and quickly retrieve file and directory entries.

    10) Networking and Routing Algorithms: AVL trees can be used in networking and routing algorithms to store and manage routing information efficiently.

    It's important to note that while AVL trees provide fast operations, 
    they do come with some overhead due to the need to maintain balance, 
    which requires rotation operations during insertion and deletion. 
    In some scenarios, other data structures like hash tables might be more suitable,
    depending on the specific use case and requirements.
